# Neural Net from scratch only using NumPy

## Goal:
Understand the fundamentals of neural networks and backpropagation. Specifically, I write my own forward and backward pass and train two- and three-layer networks with SGD and Adam optimizers.

## Requirements:
```
python3
numpy
```
## Running:
Open the file
```
neural_network.ipynb
```
